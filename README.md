The Idea is it's just a bakery's website.
First we have our generic baker man to greet the user.
Secondly we have our Navbar for future or potenial Navigation to pages, such as detailed pages on each baked good.
Thirdly the history section for the local baker vibe a heartfelt stry.
Fourthly the location, random place Iowa.
Then the aviable baked goods.
and Lastly a footer for Times and Contact information.
